# Pymaceuticals Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of cancer treatment regimens using mouse models. The data includes information about the tumor volume and weight of the mice over time for different drug regimens.

## Key Findings

1. **Treatment Efficacy**: Our analysis revealed that certain treatments significantly reduced the tumor volume over the course of the study, indicating their potential effectiveness.

2. **Correlation between Weight and Tumor Volume**: The data showed a strong positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume. This suggests that the weight of the mouse could be an important factor in the effectiveness of the treatment.

3. **Visual Patterns**: The scatter plots and line plots generated provided a clear visual representation of the data, revealing interesting patterns and trends. For instance, the scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume showed a clear positive trend.

## Future Work

The insights gained from this analysis provide a valuable foundation for further research into improving cancer treatments. Future studies could delve deeper into why certain treatments are more effective, and how factors like weight influence the effectiveness of the treatment.
